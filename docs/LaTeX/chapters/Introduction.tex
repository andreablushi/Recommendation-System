\section{Introduction}

In modern business process, predicting outcomes and providing recommendations based on historical data is crucial for improving efficiency and decision-making. 
In this project, using process monitoring and machine learning techniques, we analyze a real-life \textit{production} log to predict whether a process instance will lead to a positive (fast trace: $\text{cycle-time} < \text{avg-cycle-time}$) or negative outcome (slow trace). 
When a negative outcome is predicted, we generate recommendations that suggest changes in the sequence of activities to steer the process towards a positive result.
Then, we evaluate the effectiveness of our recommendation system by comparing the predicted outcomes with the actual outcomes in a test dataset.
