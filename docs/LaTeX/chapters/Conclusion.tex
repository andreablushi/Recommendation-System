\section{Conclusion}

Since the limitation of our dataset number of samples, the results are preliminary but promising, indicating that with more data, the recommendation system could become a valuable tool for process improvement.
Then the key findings from our evaluation suggests that the effectiveness of recommendations is highly dependent on the amount of process context available from the prefix length selected.
Longer prefixes provide more information about the process execution, enabling the recommendation system to generate more accurate and relevant suggestions.
\\\\
Overall, our project demonstrates the feasibility of using process mining and machine learning techniques to predict process outcomes and generate actionable recommendations.
With further refinement and larger datasets, such systems have the potential to significantly enhance business process management and optimization.
