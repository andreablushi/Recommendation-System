\section{Conclusion}
Due to the limited number of samples in our dataset, the results should be considered preliminary. 
Nevertheless, they are promising and suggest that, with the availability of more data, the proposed recommendation system could become a valuable tool for process improvement.
Our evaluation indicates that the effectiveness of recommendations is highly dependent on the amount of process context available.
Longer prefixes capture more detailed information about the process execution, enabling the recommendation system to generate more accurate and relevant suggestions.

Overall, this project demonstrates the feasibility of combining process mining and machine learning techniques to predict process outcomes and generate actionable recommendations.
With further refinement and larger datasets, such systems have the potential to significantly enhance business process management and optimization.
